This a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game and I have tried to make this game at a very basic level 

Programming Language: Java

Number of lines: 45

About my program : 

1 ) user input's "Rock, paper or Scissors" in a form of a string or a character value 

2 ) The input from the user is converted to the character value (by taking the value of the given string) along with this it is converted to lower case

3 ) Using Math. random (to generate random number) the digits will be between 0-9 

4 ) I have made the variable "computer" (char value)
if the generated number is between 0 and 3 then it will store Rock 
else if the generated number is between 3 to 6 it will store Paper
else if the generated number is between 6 to 9 it will store Scissors

5 ) Finally it will print the results along with the score (which I have made earlier)

Hope you have fun playing this game :)
